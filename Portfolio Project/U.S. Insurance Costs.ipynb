    "\n",
    "## The Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a __supervised predictive model__ that will estimate the total insurance cost of an individual, which will be the __target variable__, against __features__ such as BMI, age, sex, number of children, smoker, and region. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will first explore the data by analyzing summary statistics, linear regressions, and analyze each feature's relation with the __target variable__ against our predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#####  We will then __develop the model__ by following this framework: \n",
    "1. Define the performance metric ($R^2$)\n",
    "2. Analyze goodness of fit\n",
    "3. Shuffle and split the data (subsampling and testing) \n",
    "\n",
    "##### After creating the model, we __test its performance__ by conducting a bias-variance tradeoff analysis using the following methods: \n",
    "1. Learning curves (Training vs Testing MSE)\n",
    "2. Complexity curves (Training vs Validation) \n",
    "\n",
    "##### We will then finish off by __evaluating the model performance__ using the following techniques: \n",
    "1. Grid Search \n",
    "2. Cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then wrap things up by using our model, comparing it to an optimal model, and then applying it to make some predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes data provided by the [Codeacademy Pro's Data Science course](https://github.com/dannyinpyoung/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Portfolio%20Project), which is a CSV file containing 1338 unique individuals, observing the following variables: age (integer), sex (string, \"female\" or \"male\"), bmi (float), children (integer, indicating number of children), smoker (string,'yes' or 'no'), region (string, southeast, southwest, northeast, northwest), and charges (float). \n",
    "\n",
    "The project will experiment with multiple data types and dataframes as I progress into different courses and such.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the data-cleaning process, we applied processes to the data to ultimately reflect the following: \n",
    "* `Charges` to be rounded to 2 decimal spaces. \n",
    "* Adjusted one or more of the charges were entered as a string, changed type to float. \n",
    "* `Children` and `age` are converted all to integers. \n",
    "* We ensure string variables `region`, `smoker`, `sex`, do not return values outside of the possible values.  \n",

    "* Average \\% of population that smokes in the U.S. in 2016 was 15.5\\%. We see that insured individuals are more likely to be smokers. \n",
    "* Despite an almost equal representation of each sex and that female smoking rates are low and around 13.5\\% in 2016, we see an aggregate smoking rate of 20.5\\%. This suggests to look more into the smoking rates among sexes and see the impact each variable has for each gender. \n",

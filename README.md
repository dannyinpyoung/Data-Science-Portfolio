# Data Science Portfolio #

This repository consists of projects pursused for academic, hobby, and continuous learning purposes. These projects are presented in the form of Jupyterlabs Notebooks, STATA do-files, and R markdown files. 

Some of the methods we used to acquire data are: 

* Public & Private Data
* Web Scraping
* APIs
* Manual Data Acquisition
* BI Tools (Power BI and Tableau)

Some of the packages and modules used are: __Pandas, NumPy, Beautifulsoup, Matplotlib, Scikit, and etc.__

## Contents ##

* ### Data Analysis and Visualization ###

	* __Python__
		* [U.S. Insurance Costs](https://github.com/dannyinpyoung/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Portfolio%20Project): Analysis of U.S. medical insurance costs, observing factors in contract pricing such as BMI, sex, smoker status, number of children, region, and age. Developed a predictive model and analyzed model performance. 
		
	_Tools used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn._
	
* ### Machine Learning ###

* ### Financial Risk Management, Economics, and Financial Markets ###
	* __Python__ + __Excel__
		* [Implied Volatility Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/dannyinpyoung/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/IV%20Analysis/FRM%20Assignment.ipynb): Analyze and estimate implied volatility using EWMA, GARCH(1,1), and GARCH(N,M) models. Used Sum of Squared Errors and Maximum Liklihood Estimator methods for optimizing parameters with EWMA. We calculate key FRM metrics such as VaR, C-VaR, and M-VaR, and assess model performance through back-testing.
		_Tools used: Pandas, NumPy, Scipy Optimize, and Matplotlib. 
		
		* [Central Bank of Ireland LTV Systemic Risk Analysis + PDF Data Scraper](https://github.com/dannyinpyoung/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/LTV%20Project): Constructed a PDF scraper to help collect mortgage pool data published as PDFs on the Central Bank of Ireland's website. We then pre-process the data and create heatmaps, a regression fixed-effects model, and create visualizations of the data to assess the policy that capped off LTV ratios at 80% starting 2015. 
		_Tools used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Re, and PyPDF2

* ### Business Intelligence and Analytics ###
